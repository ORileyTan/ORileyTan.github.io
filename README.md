Generic Website

This is a generic github repository for me to mess around with html code and code related to html and also to test web functionality on older devices.
You can use this for testing your old devices and linking the website here is not required because it's useless for anything else other than "Hey can that old android phone play .wav files and javascript?".

--Notes--

Do Not add any kind of files with the name "nonexistantfile" it will break the "Test the 404 page
